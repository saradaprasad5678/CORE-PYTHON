**type()**
->type() is a predefined function which returns the data type of a specified variable.
ex:x=5
type(x)
**Data types**
->Data types are used to specify what type of data has to be stored in the variable.
->Without specifying data types variable memory allocation will not take place for variables.
->Programming languages supports two types of data types 
1.static
2.dynamic
**1.Static Data Types:**
-> In static data type programming languages programmer should define the data type to the variable explicitly.
->Once if we define data type to the variable explicitly, we can't modify the data type of the variable throughout the program execution.
-> C, C++,.Net, Java......... languages supports static data types.
**2.Dynamic Data Types:**
->In dynamic data type we not need to specify data type, it will be defined automatically based on user input.
->Python data types are categorized into two parts
1.Fundamental types
2.collection types
**Python Supports three types of numeric data:**
**Int**- Integer value can be any length such as integers 10, 2, 29, minus 20, minus 150 Etc.Python has no restriction on the length of an integer.Its value belongs to int.
**Float**- Float is used to store floating point numbers like 1.9, 9.902, 15.2,etc.it is accurate up to 15 decimal points.
**Complex**- A complex number contains an order to clear that is, express IY where X and Y denote the real and imaginary parts,respectively.The complex numbers like 2.14J,2.0 + 2.3j, Etc
**Bool**- It will store True and False values.

**Escape Sequnces:**
-> These are used to format the output message in the print statement.
*\n* - newline
*\b* - backspace
*\t* - horizontalspace
*\'* - to be in output with'
*\"* - to be in output with"
