**Arithmetic Operators**
Addition(+) : Add two/more values
Subtraction(-) : Subtract two/more values
Multiplication(*) : Multiplies two/more values
Divion(/) : Divides two values and gives n
Modulus(%) : Gives remainder after one value is divided with other
Exponential(**) : Gives the exponential values
Floor division(//) : Gives the integer value on dividing one value with other

**Relational Operators**
Equals to(==) : We uses it when LHS is equal to RHS 
Not equals to(!=) : When LHS is not equals to RHS
Greater than(>) : When L H S is greater than R H S
Greater than or equals to(>=) : When LHS is greater than or equals to RHS
Less than(<) : When LHS is less than RHS
Less than or equals to(<=) : When NHS is less than or equal to RHS

**Logical Operators**
logical and : if both of the operands are true, then the condition becomes true
logical or : if any of the two operands are true, then the condition becomes true
logical not : Used to reverse the logical state of its operand
