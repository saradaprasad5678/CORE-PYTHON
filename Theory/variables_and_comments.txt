1.Variables must start with either alphabet or underscore(_).
2.Variables can't start with number.
3.We can write alphanumeric value to the variable.
4.We can't use special characters in variable name.

6.No space is alllowed in variable name.
--> The only allowed characters in python are
  >Alphabets(either lower or upper case)

>we have two types of comments in python
1.single line comments
->this is defined using a (#)symbol.
ex:#this is a comment
2.multiline comments
->this is defined using thrice of double codes("")at staring of first line and ending of last line.
